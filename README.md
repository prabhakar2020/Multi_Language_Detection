# Multi Language Detection
In this example, we can see the code snippet for detecting (multiple) languages on given input sentence. Here I am using langdetect  python library for detecting the languages.

langdetect is one derived from Google language detection. As of now langdetect library detects 55 languages by calling simple function "detect". It will return the language code.

- It is very fast
- Pre-trained over a large number of languages (currently 55)
- Single langdetect library file with minimal dependencies
- Deployable as a web service
