# Multi_Language_Detection
In this example, we can see the code snippet for detecting (multiple) languages on given input sentence. Here I am using langdetect  python library for detecting the languages.

## langdetect is one derived from Google language detection. As of now langdetect library detects 55 languages by calling simple function "detect". It will return the language code.

- It is very fast
- Pre-trained over a large number of languages (currently 55)
- Single langdetect library file with minimal dependencies
- Deployable as a web service
